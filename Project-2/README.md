## Install Dependencies

This project is develop under `Ubuntu 16.04`  (`MAC OS` is fine) with `Python2`. If you do NOT have a Python2, please install Python 2 first. How to install Python 2 ? Please google it! 



Once you have the Python 2, several things need to be done before executing our code. However, we wrote a simple script to ease your work, it will install the dependencies automatically. Open your terminal, get into the Project-1 directory, and enter following command.

```bash
sh ./install.sh
```



## How to Run?

Open your terminal, get into the`src `directory where we placed our source code. Try following command to run `task 1`, if you want to execute other task, just change `1` to the corresponding task. For example, if you want to try `task 2` just change it to `--task 2`. (Note: only `1 to 5`  are supported)

```bash
python main.py --task 1
```
